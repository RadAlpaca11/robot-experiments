# Notes:
- 3 outputs
    - change in x, change in theta, change in grip
- uses llama 2 7b, which is the same that we didn't have access to for the last one
    - did not spend time getting it set up, just reading about it
- cannot identify taylor swift
- harder to understand than CogACT
    - couldn't quite understand what made it unique aside from the amount of time the word "generalist" was used
