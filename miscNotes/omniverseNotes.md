# Isaac Sim
> The fans like to go crazy when interacting with the simulator


## Notes
- default settings for DistantLight looks almost identical in appearance to DefaultLight (which is itself a DistantLight)
    - this is helpful if you mess up the default light and need to reset it
- the app has a script editor built in that you can run python snippets in, but it is not the best. There is a vscode extension that you can use to write python scripts for Isaac Sim.
