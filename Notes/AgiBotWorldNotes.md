# Summary
AgiBot World is a huge (in size and breakthrough) new open source robotics dataset.
Over 1 million trajectories, 100 robots, over 100 real scenarios in 5 areas (Home, Restaurant, Industry, Office, Supermarket).
The majority area was in the home.

It seems as if the 100 robots are made up of many 6DoF robotic arms and mobile 2 arm robots.

The training was in a facility of over 4,000 square meters (imagine robots in IKEA).

# What is in the dataset?
Various hardware including, visual tactile sensors, 6DoF robotic arms, mobile 2 arm robots.

A Jupyter Notebook is included for training diffusion policies.

# How could this be helpful?


# What does this company (AgiBot) do?
Established in February 2023 and have already started mass producing humanoid robots.
The company makes "general-purpose embodied intelligent robots" as well as manufacturing, scientific research, data collection, and more.
